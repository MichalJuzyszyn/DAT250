# First individual assignment.

- There were no problems during installation and setup of the software development environment (My choice was Visual Studio Code). To verify that everything went well, i started the IDE and wrote a line of code to check if everything runs correctly.
- I followed the steps shown at [maven website](https://maven.apache.org/) to install maven. To verify that the installation was completed succesfully i used the "mvn -v" command in terminal to check the version of maven.
- There were no issues during git installation. To verify if installation was succesfull i checked the version of git with "git --version" command.
